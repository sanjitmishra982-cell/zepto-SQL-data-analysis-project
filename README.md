# 🛒 Real E-commerce Inventory Analysis using PostgreSQL (Zepto Dataset)

✨ This project is a real-world SQL Data Analytics portfolio project built using an e-commerce inventory dataset from Zepto, one of India’s leading quick-commerce (Q-Commerce) platforms.

🎯 The objective is to simulate real data analyst work — handling messy retail data, performing data cleaning, EDA, and extracting business-driven insights using PostgreSQL.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🔹 PostgreSQL
🔹 SQL
🔹 E-commerce Inventory Dataset
🔹 Data Cleaning & Business Analysis

# 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains inventory-level details such as:

🏷️ Product name and category

💰 MRP, discount percentage, and selling price

📦 Available quantity and stock status

⚖️ Product weight in grams

⚠️ The data includes real-world issues like missing values, duplicate products, and incorrect pricing — making it ideal for practical analytics experience.

# 🔄 Project Workflow
🧱 1. Database & Schema Design

Created an inventory table in PostgreSQL

Defined proper data types and constraints

🔍 2. Data Exploration (EDA)

Counted total records

Identified missing values and duplicate products

Analyzed product categories and stock availability

🧹 3. Data Cleaning

Removed invalid pricing records (MRP = 0)

Converted prices from paise ➜ rupees

Ensured numerical consistency across columns

📈 4. Business Analysis using SQL

🏆 Identified top discounted products

🚫 Analyzed high-MRP out-of-stock items

💵 Calculated estimated revenue per category

⚖️ Found best-value products using price-per-gram analysis

📦 Segmented products into Low / Medium / Bulk categories

🏭 Calculated total inventory weight per category

# 💡 Business Insights

✅ Price-per-gram analysis helps identify the most cost-effective products
✅ Revenue analysis highlights high-performing categories
✅ Inventory weight insights support storage and logistics planning

# 🎯 Why This Project?

This project works with messy, real-world retail data, similar to what companies handle daily, making it highly relevant for data analyst roles, interviews, and portfolio reviews.

# ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository

2️⃣ Import the dataset into PostgreSQL

3️⃣ Execute the SQL scripts step by step
